NOTE
Five stage of EH
	1. Reconnaissance: Active vs passive
	2. Scanning and Enumeration: Nmap, Nessus, Nikto, etc
	3. Gaining Access: Exploitation
	4. Maintaining Access
	5. Covering Tracks

TOOLS
Infomation Gathering:
- Google
- Burpsuite
- email: hunter.io, phonebook.cz, etc
- verify email: emailhippo.com, etc
- search for breach: dehashed.com($), etc
- Domain: crt.sh, OWASP Amass, etc
- Identifying Website tecnologies: builtwith.com, wappalyzer(web extention), whatweb, etc
- searchsploit: search exploit tools that exist in exploit database (https://www.exploit-db.com/). ex: searchsploit mod_ssl 2.8 (do not be too specific)

Scanning and Enumeration:
- netdiscover(find active ip in lan)
- nmap:
	-T<value 1-5> to determind speed
	-p <port> is port -p- mean all port
	-A all or everything
	-when scan udp don't put -A and -p- because it take time to scan
	example: nmap -T3 -p- -A 10.0.2.15
- nikto(scan web):
	-h is host	
	example: nikto -h http://10.0.2.15
- dirbuster: is a file/directory penetration testing tool with a Graphic User Interface (GUI) that is used to brute force directories and file names on web application servers.
- metaploit
- smbclient:
	- is to connect to smb
	- example: smbclient -L \\\\10.0.2.15\\
- nessus: scan web vulnerabilities etc

Gaining Access: Exploitation
- netcat:
	- v option is for verbose(more detail)
	- l option is for listen it use to listen to connection
	- p option is for port 
	- e option is for excute. ex: nc 4444 -e /bin/bash (this will give bash shell to the listener, the machine that use this option will give other the shell it doesn't matter if you are listener or connector)
STARTING
1. find ip of the target if target is in lan then do netdiscover
2. scan target to find any door we can access for example: target open port 80,22,443 or other services
3. find version of service that it run
port80:
-apache: 
	1. version might show up when trying to redirect but page not found happen
	2. scan using nikto
	3. using burp suit and look for response
port22
-shh:
	1. to find ssh version then try to ssh into target sometime there is a banner that tell ssh version etc
port139:
	1.use smbclient to connect to smb and find if target allow anonymous access and try to get as much info as possible
4. take note
- webpage they are running and what version is it. ex: apache 1.3.20
- any error when redirect a webpage. ex: 404 error page
- does 404 error provide any disclose info
- port that open
- etc
- example: this is a note of kioptrix machine
10.0.2.4 (kali)
10.0.2.15 (kioptrix)
80 - 10.0.2.15
80/443 - potentially vulnereble to openfuck, (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47080), (https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck)
139 - Potentially vulnerable to tran2open, (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/10)
default webpage - apache
Info disclosure - 404 page
Info disclosure - server header disclose version info
80/tcp    open  http        Apache httpd 1.3.20 ((Unix)  (Red-Hat/Linux) mod_ssl/2.8.4 OpenSSL/0.9.6b)
+ mod_ssl/2.8.4 - mod_ssl 2.8.7 and lower are vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow which may allow a remote shell.
Webalizer Version 2.01 - http://10.0.2.15/usage/usage_200909.html
SMB: Unix (Samba 2.2.1a)
OpenSSH 2.9p2 (protocol 1.99)
Apache/1.3.20 (Unix)
5. do research a from easy to hard like port 80, 443, 139/smb is the most easiest way to target then go after ssh etc. ex: search for exploit for mod_ssl 2.8.7 on google or using searchsploit


EXTRA
reverse shell: is when target connect to us 
bind shell: is when we connect to target
