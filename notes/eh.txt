NOTE
Five stage of ethical hacking
	1. Reconnaissance: Active vs passive
	2. Scanning and Enumeration: Nmap, Nessus, Nikto, etc
	3. Gaining Access: Exploitation
	4. Maintaining Access
	5. Covering Tracks

TOOLS
Infomation Gathering:
- Google
- Burpsuite
- email: hunter.io, phonebook.cz, etc
- verify email: emailhippo.com, etc
- search for breach: dehashed.com($), etc
- Domain: crt.sh, OWASP Amass, etc
- Identifying Website tecnologies: builtwith.com, wappalyzer(web extention), whatweb, etc
Scanning and Enumeration:
- netdiscover(find active ip in lan)
- nmap:
	-T<value 1-5> to determind speed
	-p <port> is port -p- mean all port
	-A all or everything
	-when scan udp don't put -A and -p- because it take time to scan
	example: nmap -T3 -p- -A 10.0.2.15
- nikto(scan web):
	-h is host	
	example: nikto -h http://10.0.2.15
- dirbuster:
	- is a file/directory penetration testing tool with a Graphic User Interface (GUI) that is used to brute force directories and file names on web application servers.
- metaploit
- smbclient:
	- is to connect to smb
	- example: smbclient -L \\\\10.0.2.15\\


STARTING
1. find ip of the target if target is in lan then do netdiscover
2. scan target to find any door we can access for example: target open port 80,22,443 or other services
3. find version of service that it run
	port80:
		-apache: 
			1. version might show up when trying to redirect but page not found happen
			2. scan using nikto
4. if you want to find ssh version then try to ssh into target sometime there is a banner that tell ssh version etc
